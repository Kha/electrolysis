Rust `fn`s are translated to curried definitions. The return type is wrapped in a semantics monad, which in the simplest case is `option` for modelling nontermination. The proofs unwrap it using `sem.terminates_with h x`, which asserts that `x` terminates and that the predicate `h` holds on the return value.
