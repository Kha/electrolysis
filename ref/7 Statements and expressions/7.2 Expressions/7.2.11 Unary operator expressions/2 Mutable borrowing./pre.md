A mutable reference points somewhere into a local of type `T` and can read from and write into that values of type `S`. We represent this as a [`lens T S`](https://github.com/Kha/electrolysis/blob/4d67a73fc8edcb453fe4a80e21ed7286f461ffe4/thys/core/pre.lean#L17-L38) and statically keep track of which local the lens focuses on. The act of mutable borrowing translates to creating a new lens.
