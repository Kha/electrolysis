We currently translate all arms of an `if` or `match` separately, which is easy but not ideal if the control flow converges again at a later point (where 'not ideal' is a nice way of saying 'overhead exponential in the number of sequential `if`s'). It works fine for now, but we should factor out convergence points into separate helper definitions at some point (just as we're already doing for loops).
