There is no `for`, `while`, `loop`, `continue`, or `break` in MIR, just control flow edges. So we search for strongly connected components in the MIR graph (via [petgraph](https://docs.rs/petgraph/0.4.0/petgraph/algo/fn.kosaraju_scc.html)), translate them into separate helper definitions, and compute a fixed point (if any) via a generic [loop combinator](https://github.com/Kha/electrolysis/blob/master/thys/loop_combinator.lean).
